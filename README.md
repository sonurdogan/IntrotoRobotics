In this project, I and Serkan Kas  focused to build an autonomous robot.  We studied some significant topics to built autonomous robots: 

Hardware and software units of basic autonomous robots, kinematics, Robotic Operating System,  Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, SLAM, BreezySLAM algorithm.  At the end of the project, We simulated a robot that works with a SLAM algorithm.
